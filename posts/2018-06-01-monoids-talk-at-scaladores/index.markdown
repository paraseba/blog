On May 29th 2018 I gave a talk about Monoids at [Scaladores](https://www.meetup.com/scaladores/events/250823565/), the Scala meetup group in São Paulo.

Here are the [slides](https://paraseba.gitlab.io/scaladores-may-2018-talk/slides.pdf).
If you want to see the code and tests, go to the [GitHub project](https://github.com/paraseba/scaladores-may-2018-talk).

Scaladores should make the video recording available soon.
