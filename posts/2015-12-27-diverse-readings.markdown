title: Diverse readings
description: Some good books I'm currently reading
---

I usually read from two, three or more books during the same week. Unless there
is one book that I'm so passionate about that I can't put it down, I prefer
different books for different times of the day. I try to read on different
topics at the same time too.

Currently these are the books I'm working on:

## Functional Programming in Scala
> by *Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason*

It has an excellent approach to introducing
functor, applicative and monad. It constructs them out of pattern repetition, by
showing that we are writing the same code in many different domains.

Good exercises, and very good real world examples of functional code.

## Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists
> by *Benjamin C. Pierce*

I'm group reading this with friends. Very short book, seems to
be nice and to the point, but too soon to say.

## Anarchism
### A Collection of Revolutionary Writings
> by *Peter Kropotkin*

This is currently my commute book. A collection of short essays, published
originally mostly as pamphlets in Europe, during Kropotkin exile. Kropotkin is
quite a character, a former aristocrat, a scientist and mostly a profoundly
humane person.

This one gets me plenty of weird looks on the Muni.
